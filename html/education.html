                    The web design section of my course is a site I need to make for a fake corner shop like phone repair shop named ICUPhones.<br><br>
                    The main requirements for the website is for it to be easily navigable, reactive and compatable with alomost every device, browser and more, as well as being accessed through GitHub.<br><br>
                    This site was started a lot later in the year, after the start of when this site was made by a sizable amount, and you can see very easily how much progress I have made in my programming ability since then.<br><br>
                    This site also needed a boatload of documentation and more which you are able to view on the GitHub to this page. Though the page is not done and still a work in progress.<br><br>

                    Over the course of computing level two I have been working towards the Microsoft Office Specialist: Associate (Office 2019) certification by doing the relative training and exams for Word, Powerpoint and Excel.<br><br>
                    So far I have achieved the certifications for Word and Powerpoint (Seen below) and am working towards Excel to have been achieved by the end of the year.<br><br>
                    I believe that this certification will be very benificial to me, in showing my skills with computing and the very widely used Microsoft products will be benificial to any employer that may use the software.<br><br>

                    This section is very self explanitory due to it being the very website you're on right now.<br><br>
                    This websites development was started when my skills with all three programming languages was extremely limited and primative (which is one of the reasons it does not have mobile compatability.) But over time I have done little things here and there to refine the site.<br><br>
                    I've also decided that once the college year is over I may completely redo the website with all the things I have learnt to make it better and compatable with more resolutions and platforms. The redo of the site will include more reactivity, better design, more efficient code and the code will include comments.<br><br>

                    For my work experience at computing level two at the Wisbech College of West Anglia campus, I was placed into the Norfolk hospice. I truely believe that this work experience has been nothing but useful at introducing me to a working environment and I have learnt so much in my short time there.<br><br>
                    At the Norfolk hospice I have learnt a lot about working as a team, following orders, and developing a good work ethic.<br><br>
                    Through this experience I have also learnt how to work with customers, respond to feedback, and imploment that feedback among other things.<br><br>
