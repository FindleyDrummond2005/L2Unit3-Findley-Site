                    I have a base understanding of HTML and CSS from my year long level two computing course at the College of West Anglia Wisbech campus.<br><br>
                    This allows me to make basic websites such as the one you are on now with decent proficiency and allows me to solve coding problems in both languages relatively well.

                    I feel that problem solving is an extremely valuable skill and I approach that in many ways, such as engaging in puzzles, difficult challenges in games both mental and mechanical, and seeking to learn difficult topics.<br><br>
                    The way that these can be applied are extemely varied but to give some examples that may apply; programming is more of a way of problem solving than learning a language.<br><br>
                    This is because once you know how to approach a problem intuition will get you there and all you have to do is figure out the correct syntax.<br><br>
                    So from this example its easy to see I think that improving on problem solving is a skill that covers an almost infinite range of tasks that may be given.

                    I over time have watched hundreds of hours of content on the different aspects of game design and researched the topic for a similar amount of time.<br><br>\
                    It has gotten to a point where I percieve that I have a good amount of knowlage on everything from the importance of VFX, sound design, UI design to gameplay design and more topics in the larger subject.<br><br>
                    Throughout learning and researching I believe I would be able to explain and apply these game design topics in a way which could be valuable to a project.
