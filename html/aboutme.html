            <p>
                I am a 19 year old who is currently doing a game development course in the college of west anglia Kings Lynn campus.<br><br>
                The course teaches Game development with godot, 3d modelling and animation, the financial side of things, and just about everything to do with game development.<br><br>
                I am currently thinking about what I am going to do next after this course.<br><br>
                If I decide that programming is something I'd want to focus more on in the future, my dream job would be to work at the Japan based company From Software (The company who created the souls series of games games.) Or at Insomniac (The company who made the Ratchet and clank series and the Spiderman Playstation games.)<br><br>
                If I decide that animation or modelling is where my heart is, I would love to work at an indie 3D animation studio such as glitch productions as I really look up to their work, as well as the way they operate as a company.<br><br>
                I have currently found an interest in cybersec and that is possibly something I would want to persue more in the future.

                    What i am learning currently in college/what im doing to improve/what im learning at home<br><br>
                    ---Learning the basics of 3D animation---<br>I'm using the software Blender to learn basic animation in 3D.<br><br>
                    
                    ---Learning Japanese---<br>I'm using SRS flashcards and a course made by Migaku to learn the basics of the language.<br><br>

                    ---Learning Art---<br>I have been learning 2D art as well for a very short amount of time, as this is something I am lacking when it comes to making games solo.<br>

                In my free time I mainly like to play video games, watch infomative content on youtube, or watch cartoons. <br><br>
                I also enjoy looking behind the scenes to the content I watch and play such as these shows and games. <br><br>
                Another thing I enjoy is building miniatures such as gundam. it may take hours upon hours to make but its calming and the payoff is worth it.<br><br>
                I also love music, I collect vinyls, play ukulele, and am learning guitar. I'm also constantly listening to music as it is one of my biggest passions.<br><br>
