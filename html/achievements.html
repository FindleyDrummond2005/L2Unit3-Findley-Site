                    I was planning to go to the Wisbech grammer school and I got almost all the way there. I managed to pass the entrance exam with flying colours and get full bursary that would completely pay for me to be at the course but due to me doing this mid way though the year, they had ran out of bursary funding and I was not able to afford it.

            <div class="achievement_content"><p>This is a very personal achievement but I've decided to add it here because I believes it shows personal drive and creativity. I have spent the last three years playing instruments and occasionally writing music, and after a month or two of learning my first instrument (the ukulele) I wrote my own song with original chord progressions and lyrics. Even though it was a very rough song and needs major improvement I am very happy with all it taught me about perseverence and more which is why I have placed it here.</p></div>

                    This one is still a work in progress but I'm already proud of just the idea of the game. I have made the 3D model for the two characters, taking a low poly ps1 look to the models (Going as far when I develop the game to possibly have vertex snapping and other things made from the limitations of the ps1 hardware.) And the model has been fully rigged also by me with appropriate naming for each bone.
                    The idea is a story driven game about two immortal beings watching the end of time, they have just as many questions as we do and its even more confusing to these two beings due to them being immortal, so you get to choose how you interact with the other being with dialogue options. There will be branching dialogue paths and if you want the full idea contact me at findleydrummondimp@gmail.com.
